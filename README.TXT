6. Once you are greeted with the projects screen, select "Open" and open "KumiteGame" folder which is located in my SVN(code > Final Project > KumiteGame).

7. If you are having trouble with installing unity I have referenced a video on how to run Unity(go to this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkV5X6FWvrM).

8. When the game is loaded, underneath the Game tab, open the resolution drop down menu(Should be Free Aspect by default), click the plus button at the bottom and create a new fixed resolution and set it to 1334 width and 750 length.  

9. In the projects tab(usually located at the bottom of the Unity window), go to the Assets folder, then go to the Scenes folder and double click on "Main Menu" or right click it and choose open.

10. When the Main Menu scene is open, we can now run the game, on the top of the Unity window there is a Play,Pause and Skip button, click play to start the game. 

**Important** When running the game you must ALWAYS run the Main Menu scene first due to the fact that the rest of the scenes are dependant on it and will throw exceptions if the main scene is not ran first. Never run any other scene in the scene folder separately, always run Main Menu only.
